# Sections Folder

This folder contains section-specific components that are organized based on different functional areas of the application. Each section represents a major feature or domain area within the dashboard application.

## Purpose

The sections folder helps organize components that:

1. Are specific to a particular application domain or feature area
2. May consist of multiple smaller components working together
3. Represent a complete UI section rather than a reusable UI element
4. Are too complex or domain-specific to fit in general component folders

## Folder Structure

```
sections/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── dashboard-overview.tsx
│   ├── dashboard-filters.tsx
│   └── widget-grid.tsx
├── analytics/
│   ├── metrics-overview.tsx
│   ├── performance-chart.tsx
│   └── traffic-breakdown.tsx
├── user-management/
│   ├── user-profile-section.tsx
│   ├── permissions-panel.tsx
│   └── activity-log.tsx
└── ... (other section directories)
```

## Naming Conventions

Component files in the sections folder should follow this naming convention:

- `[section]-[component-name].tsx`

For example:

- `dashboard-filters.tsx`
- `analytics-metrics-overview.tsx`
- `user-management-permissions-panel.tsx`

## Section Component Guidelines

Section components should:

1. Focus on composition rather than individual UI elements
2. Import and use smaller components from other folders (ui, forms, tables)
3. Handle section-specific state and logic
4. Connect to data sources needed for that specific section
5. Handle routing and navigation specific to that section

## Examples

### Dashboard Section Component

```tsx
import { PageHeader } from "@/components/ui/page-header";
import { DashboardWidgetGrid } from "./dashboard-widget-grid";
import { DashboardControls } from "./dashboard-controls";
import { useGetDashboardQuery } from "@/queries/dashboard/dashboard";

export function DashboardView({ dashboardId }) {
  const { data: dashboard, isLoading } = useGetDashboardQuery({
    id: dashboardId,
  });

  if (isLoading) return <DashboardSkeleton />;

  return (
    <div className="dashboard-container">
      <PageHeader
        title={dashboard.name}
        description={dashboard.description}
        actions={<DashboardActions dashboard={dashboard} />}
      />
      <DashboardControls
        timeRange={dashboard.timeRange}
        refreshInterval={dashboard.refreshInterval}
      />
      <DashboardWidgetGrid
        widgets={dashboard.widgets}
        layout={dashboard.layout}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Analytics Section Component

```tsx
import { MetricsCards } from "./metrics-cards";
import { PerformanceChart } from "./performance-chart";
import { useAnalyticsData } from "@/queries/analytics/analytics";

export function AnalyticsOverview() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useAnalyticsData();

  return (
    <div className="analytics-container">
      <MetricsCards metrics={data?.metrics} isLoading={isLoading} />
      <PerformanceChart data={data?.performanceData} isLoading={isLoading} />
      <TrafficBreakdown trafficData={data?.trafficData} isLoading={isLoading} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Integration with Page Components

Section components typically:

1. Are imported and used within page components
2. Handle the section-specific data fetching and logic
3. Compose smaller UI components into cohesive sections
4. Separate complex page layouts into manageable pieces

## When to Create a New Section

Create a new section when:

1. You have a distinct functional area of the application
2. The component is too complex to be a simple UI component
3. You need to group related components under a common domain
4. The functionality represents a standalone feature area

## Relationships with Other Component Types

- **UI Components**: Sections use these as building blocks
- **Forms**: Sections may include or wrap form components
- **Tables**: Sections may include table components with additional controls
- **Layouts**: Sections are typically used within layout components but may also include layout-specific components

## Best Practices

1. Keep section components focused on their specific domain area
2. Extract reusable UI elements to appropriate component folders
3. Use composition to build complex interfaces from simpler components
4. Maintain a consistent level of abstraction within each section folder
5. Consider creating sub-sections for very complex areas
