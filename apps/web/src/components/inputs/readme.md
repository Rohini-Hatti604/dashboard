# Inputs Folder

This folder contains common form input components that can be reused across the application. These components are designed to provide a consistent user interface and experience for all form interactions.

## Available Components

The input components in this folder can include:

- Text inputs (single line and multi-line)
- Select/dropdown menus
- Checkbox inputs
- Radio button groups
- Toggle switches
- Date and time pickers
- Number inputs
- File upload inputs

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Use these components for all form inputs to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

2. **Props**: Each component accepts standard HTML input props along with additional custom props for enhanced functionality.

3. **Validation**: These components are designed to work with form validation libraries like Formik, React Hook Form, or Zod.

4. **Accessibility**: All components are built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines if possible.

5. **Styling**: Components use the application's design system and can be themed according to the project requirements.
