# UI Components Folder

This folder contains the core UI components that form the foundation of our design system. These components are the building blocks for creating consistent, accessible, and responsive user interfaces throughout the application.

## Purpose

The UI folder organizes atomic and composite UI components that:

1. Implement our design system's visual language and patterns
2. Provide consistent user interaction models across the application
3. Abstract common UI patterns into reusable components
4. Ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG standards
5. Support theming and visual customization

## Component Types

### Atomic Components

These are the core building blocks of the UI:

- `button.tsx` - Various button styles and states
- `input.tsx` - Text input field with variants
- `checkbox.tsx` - Selection control for binary choices
- `radio.tsx` - Selection control for mutually exclusive options
- `select.tsx` - Dropdown selection menus
- `toggle.tsx` - Switch between two states
- `card.tsx` - Container for grouping related content

### Composite Components

These are more complex components built from atomic components:

- `data-table.tsx` - Advanced table with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- `date-picker.tsx` - Date selection with calendar interface
- `color-picker.tsx` - Visual color selection tool
- `file-upload.tsx` - File selection and upload progress

## Component Guidelines

All UI components should:

1. **Be fully typed**: Use TypeScript for prop definitions and component typing
2. **Support accessibility**: Include ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
3. **Be responsive**: Adapt appropriately to different screen sizes
4. **Support theming**: Use CSS variables for theming capabilities
5. **Handle all states**: Account for normal, hover, focus, disabled, and loading states
6. **Be well-documented**: Include prop documentation and usage examples
7. **Be testable**: Design with testability in mind

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";

export function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <Card className="p-6 w-full max-w-md">
      <form className="space-y-4">
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
          <Input id="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" />
        </div>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <Label htmlFor="password">Password</Label>
          <Input
            id="password"
            type="password"
            placeholder="Enter your password"
          />
        </div>
        <Button type="submit" className="w-full">
          Sign In
        </Button>
      </form>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Integration with Design System

The UI components in this folder implement our design system specifications, ensuring:

1. **Visual consistency**: All components share the same visual language
2. **Interactive behaviors**: Components have consistent interaction patterns
3. **Spacing system**: Components follow a consistent spacing scale
4. **Typography**: Text elements use the defined typography system
5. **Color palette**: Components use the defined color system

## Component Architecture

Our UI components follow these architectural principles:

1. **Composition over inheritance**: Components are designed to be composable
2. **Controlled and uncontrolled modes**: Components support both patterns where appropriate
3. **Forward refs**: Components forward refs to allow parent components to access DOM elements
4. **Slot pattern**: Many components use the slot pattern for flexible composition
5. **Context providers**: Some components use React context for state sharing

## Accessibility

All UI components prioritize accessibility by:

1. Supporting keyboard navigation
2. Including appropriate ARIA attributes
3. Maintaining sufficient color contrast
4. Supporting screen readers
5. Handling focus management
6. Providing text alternatives for non-text content

## Best Practices

When working with UI components:

1. **Prefer composition**: Compose simple components instead of creating complex monolithic ones
2. **Minimize prop drilling**: Use context or composition patterns for deep component trees
3. **Keep components focused**: Components should do one thing well
4. **Consistent naming**: Follow established naming conventions
5. **Document variants**: Clearly document all component variants and props
6. **Consider performance**: Watch for unnecessary re-renders or heavy computations
7. **Test all states**: Ensure components work correctly in all possible states
